# Guam Golf Course Superintendant Russell Young Wins the GCSAA Innovative Conservation Award for Managing Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles Based on Research by the University of Guam 

The Golf Course Superintendents Association of America (GCSAA) named four superintendents winners of the 2022 Environmental Leaders in Golf Awards (ELGA). GCSAA in partnership with Syngenta, present the awards annually ([announcement](https://www.golfdom.com/gcsaa-names-four-environmental-leaders-in-golf-award-winners/)).

Young, who is superintendent of the Palm Tree Golf Course on Andersen Air Force Base, won the Innovative Conservation Award for managing coconut rhinoceros beetles. Many coconut palms on his course were killed by rhino beetles. In response, he cut down infested trees, stacked  them in a piles and covered them with teken netting, creating traps. Tekken is a gill net used by Chamorro fishermen to catch small fish. 

Use of tekken netting as an effective tool for managing rhino beetles was discovered by Dr. Aubrey Moore and Roland Quitugua at UOG with the help of a couple of local fishermen: Johny “Atulai” Taitano and Frank Cushing. For more information please see *Fishing for rhinos with tekken* in the [Western Paciific Tropical Research Center 2014 Impact Report](https://www.uog.edu/_resources/files/2014-impactsmall.pdf).
